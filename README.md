Have you ever seen a jungle tree growing in a snowy tundra? Me neither! Trees will have trouble growing outside biomes where they naturally grow with this plugin.

The plugin will automatically work as is, you can also configure how effective bone meal is and whether trees should have a growing chance at all.

## Config
```yaml
# Everytime a tree attempts to grow outside its preferred
# biome, this will determine how likely it will succeed
naturalGrowthChance: 0.0

# Everytime bonemeal is used on a tree outside its preferred
# biome, this will determine how likely the tree will grow
boneMealChance: 0.25
```
